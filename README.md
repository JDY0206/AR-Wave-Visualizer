AR Wave Visualizer

# Overview #

The AR Wave Visualizer is a project that aims to make invisible electromagnetic (EM) signals visible in near real-time through an augmented reality headset.
By combining software-defined radios (SDRs), signal processing, and AR visualization, the system allows users to “see” wireless signals such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular connections as immersive wave patterns.
