AR Wave Visualizer

📖 Overview

The AR Wave Visualizer is a project that aims to make invisible electromagnetic (EM) signals visible in near real-time through an augmented reality headset.

By combining software-defined radios (SDRs), signal processing, and AR visualization, the system allows users to “see” wireless signals such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular connections as immersive wave patterns.

✨ Features

📡 Signal Visualization – Render WiFi, cellular, and Bluetooth signals as dynamic waves or vector fields.

🔀 Signal Mode Switching – Toggle between signal types to reduce clutter and avoid overlapping noise.

⏱ Adjustable Update Speed – Control how fast the visuals refresh (tradeoff between realism and clarity).

🎒 Portable Design – Backpack houses SDR hardware, battery, and processing unit.

🕶 AR Integration – Visualizations aligned with headset tracking for immersive experience.

🛠 System Architecture

Headset

Displays EM visualizations.

Includes mode-switching buttons.

Backpack Unit

Contains SDR unit(s).

Provides power supply and processing hardware.

Software

Collects SDR data.

Applies FFTs, filtering, and noise reduction.

Converts signals into AR-ready waveforms and patterns.

⚠️ Current Limitations

Hardware Constraints – SDR sensitivity, antenna quality, and wearable integration.

Signal Ambiguity – Overlapping signals (e.g., 2.4 GHz WiFi & Bluetooth) can cause interference.

Data Processing – Real-time FFTs and AR rendering demand high computing power.

Latency – Visualizations may lag due to hardware/software delays.

Portability – Backpack form factor could become bulky.

Battery Life – High power draw from continuous SDR + AR rendering.

Regulatory Compliance – Must remain passive (non-transmitting) to meet FCC restrictions.

🚀 Roadmap

 Mockups and hardware diagrams.

 Basic SDR data capture + offline visualization.

 Develop prototype AR rendering pipeline.

 Integrate headset + backpack prototype.

 Optimize for latency, portability, and power.
