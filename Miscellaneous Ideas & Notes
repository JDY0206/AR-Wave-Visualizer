Use a backpack for power?
 - How much power is the processing going to draw? 
 - Will it be possible for the headset to be run off of batteries or will it be restricted to being plugged in? 
 - Would it still be safe to run the headset off of a battery power supply?
Processing?
 - What processor should I use? 
 - Potentially use a biker helmet to equip sensors on the top and link AR.
Look at other AR Projects.
 - Mainly looking at wave modeling from games out, stuff like ray tracing and hyper realistic graphics could give me an idea as to how to model things like the waves I want to model. 
Look into Apple vision pro compatibility. 
 - Would it work if I used this headset? 
 - If not, what other headsets could I use? 
Find what software to use.
 - Basically between just using python or using Unity. 
Pick a few main sensors for a main 3 types of waves to switch between 
 - Distinguishing between similar waves is going to be tricky. 
Look into a module that can switch between these main types of waves I want to visualize. 
Headset Directional Sensors:
 - How am I going to coordinate the visuals with where the headset is facing?
 - What additional sensors will this require? 
Need funding 
 - Especially if Iâ€™m going to use good hardware 
 - Build 2 different plans for the headset 
    - 1 budget one, using parts that I personally could afford
    - A 2nd optimal rig, if I were to get a grant or something for this project
    - And can use my list of parts to work in between the two as money comes in, if it does
